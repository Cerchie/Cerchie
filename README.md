### I'm [Lucia Cerchie](https://luciacerchie.dev/)!
#### I'm a software engineer from the Southwestern US. I love diving in and learning how to create something from scratch-- from CSS hamburgers to my own ORMs. I'm fascinated with GraphQL and a11y, and I like to blog about the [new things I'm learning](https://dev.to/cerchie).

### Contact
#### If you want to talk about anything JavaScript or GraphQL, feel free to message me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/CerchieLucia).
