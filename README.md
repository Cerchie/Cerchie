# Hey there, I'm [Lucia Cerchie!](http://luciacerchie.dev)

I'm a developer advocate from the Southwestern US. I believe in a human-centered developer experience, in the teaching responsibility of developer advocates, and in the joy of learning.

I'm a contributing volunteer at [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io/), and I currently work at Confluent.

I moonlight as a haiku writer and avid doodler.
