# Hey there, I'm Lucia Cerchie! ⭐

I'm a developer advocate from the Southwestern US. 🌵

I love to create content that teaches people how to get started and keep coding. 🚀

I'm a contributing member at [Virtual Coffee](https://virtualcoffee.io/), where I co-host weekly zoom rooms and help plan for our Hacktoberfest initiative. 🎃
